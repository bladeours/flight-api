## General Info
This REST API is a part of Flight Search Engine project. \
I've created this project to get information about flights, I'm using it in
[flight search engine MVC](https://github.com/bladeours/flight-search-engine) project.
It uses MySQL database to store data and uses [flight generator](https://github.com/bladeours/random-flights-generator) to
generate flights.


## Technologies Used
* Spring
* Java 17
* MySQL

## Setup

### Run with docker

#### Docker-compose
* `git clone https://github.com/bladeours/flight-api.git`
* `docker-compose -d`

if you want to change ports or credentials then edit `.env` file. \
Unfortunately container with api needs to restart couple times because it needs wait for
mysql container at this moment. I'll improve this in the future. 

### Install on local machine

#### Install MySQL
check official [MySQL Documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/5.7/en/)

#### Create database & import data
```
Type: mysql -u username -p any_database_name < database/create_whole_database.sql
script create database so you don't have worry about database name
If you've assigned a password, type it now and press Enter.
```
#### Run API
**this app requires Java 17** \
* Download [release](https://github.com/bladeours/flight-api/releases/latest)
* `java -jar flightApi.jar`
* app runs on port 8082
